    <quest:name>Smuggler's Heaven</quest:name>
    <quest:description>In the world of smuggling, an edge over the opposition and authorities is one of the greatest virtues to have. Aldrez, a roguish man with dark ambitions, knows this all to well. He contacted you to help him gain the most devious of advantages for those who work in the night, vampirism. If you so consider it, perhaps you will find a good reward at the end of it all, at the cost of Aldrez's humanity.</quest:description>
