      <quest:description>Cast aside the secret fear within, you approach the mad mage himself. Volkstein will present a challenge unlike one you have ever faced before. But for the reward, perhaps the price is to pay is appropriate?</quest:description>

      <quest:description>Volkstein has ceased to be, however he was already a shadow of his former self. You have obtained the "Eye of the Crow" from his maddening, dark - pitiful home. You must return to the Witch, for it is time to rid yourself of this terrible curse.</quest:description>

      <quest:description>Perhaps you should have foreseen it, but Auster is just as mad as Volkstein. You have been left with only one choice, defend yourself and draw blood! Lest - they will only find your body in segments.</quest:description>

      <quest:description>Sympathy overcomes even a cold and hardened heart. Auster is perhaps with Volkstein, in a better place? It is hard to tell. The present is dark but the future remains bright. Return to the Guild with the book you have found, guard it close to your chest - as if it were your destiny itself.</quest:description>

      <quest:description>You could have made away with that book, but instead - after you indulged in its knowledge, you have contributed it to the Guild's library. They will not forget this. Its a grim text, but in it - you have achieved something greater - that Auster and Volkstein lost. Life. Your curse is to be no more.</quest:description>
