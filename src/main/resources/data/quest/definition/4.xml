    <quest:name>Cursed Heroes</quest:name>
    <quest:description>A terrible curse, a terrible secret and to conclude - many terrible revelations! You have discovered the entrance to a crypt, but are unable to open it by any normal means. Curious of its origins, its purpose and what it may hold inside as far as treasures and riches go, you must seek out the help of a Mage from Sevgard. The consequences for this voyage however will be unforeseen, what is in the dark will be revealed in time - but your life will be in grave danger through out. From the crypt, you will enter a dungeon - which is crawling with the most unsightly things. Death has become something different here, mangled by a curse as ancient as the legendary heroes who are laid to rest here themselves.</quest:description>

            <quest:description>You have met Renault the Mage. He is a bit of an odd man, but you take a liking to each other early on. After some rough conversation, you are able to pinpoint the location of the place you have discovered. Renault is interested now, while skeptical at first, he is now on board to come with you to investigate the crypt with the statues. Now, with a private ensemble of bodyguards in tow, the two of you proceed forward on an adventure.</quest:description>
